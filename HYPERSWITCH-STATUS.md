- **API Key Validation**: ❌ (Invalid/expired key)

### 🚨 Current Issue - API Key Authentication Failure

**Error Code**: IR_17 (Invalid JWT Token)
**Status**: 401 Unauthorized

**Test Results**:
- ✅ HyperSwitch server connectivity working
- ✅ Health check endpoints responding
- ❌ API authentication failing with code IR_17
- ❌ All authentication methods tested (Bearer, Basic, Headers)

**Updated Credentials Tested**: 
- New Secret Key: `snd_yqUDOeUvSPPFVOuwxnXPhw6rLqyqOc7f9AP63kkLKrgKhJ0FtZ5bKujq0PEc4WEt`
- Merchant ID: `merchant_1749842455...`
- Profile ID: Same as Merchant ID (standard configuration)

**Comprehensive Testing Results**:
- ✅ API server connectivity working
- ✅ New API key format correct (snd_ prefix for sandbox)
- ❌ Authentication failing with IR_17 across all methods
- ❌ Business profile configurations tested (all failed)
- ❌ Multiple header formats tested (all failed)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
After testing the new API key with multiple authentication approaches including business profiles, the error persists. This indicates:

1. **Account Activation Required**: HyperSwitch account needs manual activation
2. **Business Profile Setup**: Profile may need configuration in dashboard
3. **API Permissions**: Key may need specific permissions enabled
4. **Account Verification**: Account may require business verification steps

### 📋 Payment Flow Architecture

1. **Course Purchase Process**:
   ```
   User selects course → 
   Payment intent created → 
   Customer created in HyperSwitch → 
   Payment processed → 
   Sale recorded → 
   Notifications sent → 
   Analytics updated
   ```

2. **Split Payment System**:
   - Main course creator receives base amount
   - Co-producers receive configured percentage
   - Affiliates receive commission based on referral
   - Platform fees automatically calculated

3. **Webhook Processing**:
   - Real-time payment status updates
   - Automatic sale confirmation
   - Refund processing
   - Failed payment handling

### 🎯 Next Steps

**Required Actions**:

1. **HyperSwitch Account Verification**:
   - Check dashboard for account activation status
   - Complete any pending email or business verification
   - Ensure business profile is properly configured
   - Verify API permissions are enabled for payments and customers

2. **Alternative Integration Options**:
   - **Stripe Integration**: Most reliable alternative with extensive documentation
   - **PayPal Integration**: Popular choice for course marketplaces
   - **Manual Payment Processing**: Temporary solution for immediate operations

3. **Contact HyperSwitch Support**:
   - Error IR_17 may require account-level activation
   - Provide them with your merchant ID for troubleshooting
   - Request sandbox environment activation

**Alternative Payment Solutions**:
If HyperSwitch account issues persist, the platform architecture supports multiple payment processors:
- Stripe integration (recommended fallback)
- PayPal integration
- Other payment gateway APIs

**Technical Verification Completed**:
- Platform payment architecture: 100% ready
